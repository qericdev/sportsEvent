# Sports Event

A preliminary version of the challenge code.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- Typescript
- React
- CSS

## Considerations
- App.tsx do the API request and saves the data.
- Data is replicated using map to other components (Data -> Event -> Market -> Selection).
- When an element is selected, the selection data is passed back through the components to App.tsx and after that, is sent to Betslip component.
- App is not completed yet: 

## To Improve
- Multiple selections can't be allowed.
- Save all selections option needs to be implemented.
- Minor details in the UI.
